# Battleship
The game of battleship created in Java. The program uses 6 total classes, the Asker class goes through the procedure of the game, the Grid class creates and stores data on player battleship grids,
the Location class determines the status of each coordinate on a grid, the Ship class creates the different battleships, the Player class creates a player that stores the five ships under it, and 
the main class Battleship ties these all together to create the game.
